cynq
====

cynq is a core framework to aide in syncing of remote data stores.

You are able to sync 1 or many remote sources of data with a local source.  
It takes care of bidirectional syncing for you so you don't have to worry
about it.  You just gotta make sure you have a couple extra columns in your
local data table to record how and when things were updated, and you need 
to make sure that you update a column appropriately on certain types of updates
and then you're good to go.

still more work to be done to make this completely client friendly, but it
is viable as it exists today

still lots more docs to add

TODO: add docs so someone else can grok (or I can grok after a couple months off)
